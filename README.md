This repository includes the assignments described in "Tightly Coupled Worksheets and Homework Assignments for NLP", submitted to the Sixth Workshop on Teaching NLP at ACL 2024. The repository is organized as follows:

* Materials for each of the three assignments (Language Identification with Naive Bayes, Part-of-Speech Tagging with Hidden Markov Models, Beam Search with GPT-2) are in individual directories (`NaiveBayes`, `HiddenMarkovModel`, `BeamSearch`).
* Each directory contains the following:
  * `worksheet.pdf`: the PDF version of in-class worksheet given for the assignment.
  * `worksheet.tex`: the tex version of in-class worksheet given for the assignment (if you would like to edit it).
  * `assignment.pdf`: a PDF version of the homework assignment.
  * `assignment.md`: a markdown version of the homework assignment, e.g., for rendering on a course website with Jekyll.
  * `report.md`: a report that students must submit with each assignment.
  * `README.md`: a README file describing all assignment-specific files and components of the assignment that are not described in the workshop paper.

In cases where starter code could be used by students who are completing a similar assignment for which no starter code was provided, this repository contains limited starter code. A private repository is available with complete starter code and gradescope autograders; contact lbiester@middlebury.edu and share your name, affiliation, and the course that you are teaching for access to that repository.
