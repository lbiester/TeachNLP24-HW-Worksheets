# Report: Language Identification with Naive Bayes
## Evaluating evaluation metrics
### What is one advantage of using accuracy over a confusion matrix to evaluate your model?



### What is one advantage of using a confusion matrix over accuracy to evaluate your model?



### Interpreting your confusion matrix
_Choose a language from the data set. Given any knowledge that you have about properties about that language (e.g., writing system, language families), explain any unique properties of its row in the confusion matrix, including (a) performance compared to other languages, (b) languages that it is more likely to be predicted as than others, and (c) anything else you think is relevant._




## Effects of priors
Update your code so that your prior is uniform, e.g., the probability for each of the 8 languages is $log\left(\frac{1}{8}\right)$. Then, answer the following questions.
### How do your results change? Why?



### Describe a situation in which you might _want_ to use a uniform prior.
